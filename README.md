## üîç Introduction
This project is a fork of `gowitness`, which is a website screenshot utility written in Golang, that uses Chrome Headless to generate screenshots of web interfaces using the command line, with a handy report viewer to process results. Both Linux and macOS is supported, with Windows support mostly working.

Inspiration for `gowitness` comes from [Eyewitness](https://github.com/ChrisTruncer/EyeWitness).
